1. Ok, this is getting pretty cool, but it’s a bit of a headache to have to edit your code every time you want to see a different pattern. Wouldn’t it be good to get the program to ask you for them? You can do that!

 First, create **variables** in **data** for "degrees" and "increase" and add them to your code like this: ![](assets/ask1.png)

2. Now you need to ask for values for these two **variables** and store them. You do this using a sensing block called `"Ask and wait"`, which you can type a question into. Pull one into your **sprite panel** and change the ques;on to "How many steps should I grow by?", then add it to your program, just after you set steps to 0, like this: ![](assets/ask2.png)
 * How many steps should I grow by?

3. Once you’ve got Scratch asking a question, you need it to remember the answer! It turns out that Scratch has a special **variable**, called `"answer"`, where it puts the most recent answer it’s received. You can find it among the **sensing** blocks. Using a **data** `"set to "` block, take the value from `"answer"` and give it to "increase" like so: ![](assets/ask3.png)

4. Now, do the same thing with "degrees", asking "How many degrees should I turn?" and storing the _answer_ in "degrees". ![](assets/ask4.png)


5. Check your program now looks like the one below and run it a few times, trying different numbers. Write down the answers that make the coolest pictures. You’ll need them on a later card! ![](assets/ask5.png)
